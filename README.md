# Introduction
Modding FortBlox is kind of hard if you do not know any of the item/assets ids and the event codenames and paths to find the event and trigger<br>
This is a step-by-step tutorial on how to use any command that is below to do it for seeing old events, etc<br><br>

# Injection of Code
Injection of Code can be easy with hooks into the Roblox Client by using Executor software ( Recommended: [Synapse X](https://synapse-x.co/) )<br>
but if you want to make sure you do not get detected I would recommend making your own executor in C#, or C++ or whatever you are fluent in.<br>
After that injection should be really easy. After you get the executor working you would need some commands to delete assets, trigger events, etc<br>
But please be aware that this can lead to permanent and immeadiate bans on your Roblox Account from playing FortBlox and could even be sent to Roblox to<br> ban your account<br><br>

# Commands
There are some commands you can use to prank people or use in a private match. Most commands will be listed below to use.<br><br>

Trigger Event: `Workspace.LiveEvents.<eventcodename>.Disabled = false` (you can find codenames [here](https://github.com/FortBloxLeaker/Event-Codenames/blob/main/Codenames.md))<br>
Destroy Object: `Workspace.<object>:destroy()` (Objects can be found [here](https://github.com/FortBloxLeaker/Item-Asset-Codenames/blob/main/codenames.md) )<br><br>

# Warning
We are not responsible for any bans that have been taken on your account (Roblox Bans, FortBlox Bans, etc). This is for educational purposes only so we recommend using a<br>
Private Server while using these commands. These tricks can lead into a competitive advantage as you can cause destruction as in ruin a whole match by deleting buildings<br>
or even some grounds can be destroyable.
